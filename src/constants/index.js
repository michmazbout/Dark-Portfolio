export const HERO_CONTENT = `Environmental Engineer with expertise in geospatial analysis, machine learning, and sustainable systems. With field experience across Swiss glaciers and rivers, I combine technical engineering skills with environmental science to develop data-driven solutions for ecological challenges. My work in sediment analysis, climate impact studies, and environmental monitoring bridges the gap between research and practical conservation strategies.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am a multidisciplinary Environmental Engineer with a Master's from the University of Lausanne and field experience across Switzerland. My work focuses on:
- Glacial erosion analysis using QGIS/ArcGIS
- Machine learning for environmental monitoring (97% accuracy oil spill detection)
- Sustainable system design (30% water reduction in smart irrigation)
- River sediment management ($2M potential annual savings identified)

Fluent in 4 languages, I thrive in international research teams and have contributed to policies affecting over 100 communities. My technical toolkit includes Python, MATLAB, LiDAR processing, and computational fluid dynamics, applied to solve real-world environmental challenges.`;
